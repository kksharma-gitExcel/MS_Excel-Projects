Separate Movies by Year

Purpose:
- Analyzes a master movie dataset on "Sheet1".
- Separates movie records into individual sheets based on "release year"
- Two different approaches are used (in separate subroutines) to achieve the same goal.
- Ensures only one copy of each yearly sheet is created and existing non-Sheet1 sheets are deleted beforehand.

Sub Procedures:

=> FIRST METHOD
-----------------------------
1. DeleteSheets
- Deletes all worksheets except Sheet1.
- Suppresses deletion confirmation alerts using `Application.DisplayAlerts = False`.

---

2. SeparateMovieByYear_1
- Iterates through each movie entry in column A.
- Extracts the release year from the adjacent cell in column B.
- For each unique year:
  - Creates a new worksheet named `"Movie Year - [Year]"` if it doesn't exist.
  - Copies the row of data into that year's sheet, preserving formatting and column widths.
- Uses a helper function `SheetExists` to check for existing sheets.

---

=> SECOND METHOD
-------------------------------
3. SeparateMovieByYear_2 (Using AutoFilter)
- Deletes all extra sheets using `DeleteSheets`.
- Creates a temporary sheet and generates a unique sorted list of years from column B using the `UNIQUE(SORT(YEAR(...)))` formula.
- For each year:
  - Creates a new sheet named `"MovieYear - [Year]"` if it doesnâ€™t exist.
  - Filters the main dataset based on that year using `AutoFilter`.
  - Copies the visible (filtered) rows into the corresponding sheet.
- Cleans up:
  - Deletes the temporary sheet used to calculate unique years.
  - Autofits all columns in all sheets.

=>THIRD METHOD
------------------------------
4. SeparateMovieByYear_3 (Using Advanced Filter)
- Same function as SeparateMovieByYear_2 Sub Procedure but using advanced filter instead autofilter.

Helper Function:
"SheetExists"
- Returns `True` if a sheet with the specified name already exists, otherwise `False`.
- Prevents errors from duplicate sheet creation.
